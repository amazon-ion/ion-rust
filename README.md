A Rust implementation of the [Amazon Ion][spec] data format.

Includes the feature `experimental-ion-hash` which is an implementation of [Ion Hash][ion-hash-spec].

***This package is considered experimental, under active/early development, and the API is subject to change.***

## Development

This project uses a submodule to pull in [Ion Tests][ion-tests] and [Ion Hash Tests][ion-hash-tests].
The easiest way to pull everything in is to clone the repository recursively:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-rust
```

You can also initialize the submodules as follows:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Building the project:

```bash
$ cargo build --workspace --all-features
```

Running all tests for `ion-rust`:

```bash
$ cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

Our continuous integration builds/tests, checks formatting, builds all API docs including private,
and clippy linting, you will likely want to check most of these to avoid having to wait until the
CI finds it:

```bash
$ ./clean-rebuild.sh
```
