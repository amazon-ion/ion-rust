A Rust binding to [Ion C][ion-c] which implements the [Amazon Ion][spec] data format.

***This package is considered experimental, under active/early development, and the API is subject to change.***

## Development

See [Ion Rust][ion-rust] for details.  This crate is currently developed in concert with Ion Rust
as a [Cargo workspace][cargo-workspace].

Notably, building this crate requires [pre-requisites for `bindgen`][bindgen-req], a modern C/C++ compiler,
and [`cmake`][cmake].
